## ---------------- Printing --------------- ##
print("Hello World") # Basic print, adds newline 
print("Hello World With No Newline", end = " ") # Specify end character, default is newline 
print("Hello World")

# Trying to print variable
x = 10
# print("Value of x is " + x) 
# This won't work as you are trying to combine 
# string and int, do it this way instead:
print("Value of x is " + str(x))
# or print int without string:
print(x)
